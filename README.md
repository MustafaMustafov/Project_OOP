# Restaurant management system

The RMS automate the work of the waiters and the chefs in the restaurant. There are two rolss - Waiter and Chef.Users can be created only by Manager's account. The waiter can perform tasks like menu creation/add,remove items/, orders action / create, edit, display, remove, served meals or drinks. Chef can check the list of active order, to change status of meals to cooked then to be served by waiter.
Every user will be logged in by entering user and password as both can manage one and the same order list. Order list will be saved in a file and each time when certain user is logged in his list will be loaded. The list for chef will be the last used waiter's order list.
